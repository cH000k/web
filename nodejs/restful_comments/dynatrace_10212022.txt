break scripts into two

we need to get the date time and url of the workspace

open jeff's dt script to a new tab

Anagha crates a new synthetic and Jeff asks to DL and edit JS code, copy from line 252 all the way to the top

get datetime out of DOM

On new synthetic edit the Script and paste the one we copy until line 252


~~2nd try

copy Anagha's initial script from Anagha's DT, copy from 236 until 252 
after


paste to 232?? all the js code from Jeff to Anagha

The rest of functionality might need to be done using JS


Name of New Synthetic: AP Domino Data Labs - Producer

Run  AP Domino Data Labs - Producer then we need to run another Synthetic afterwards


Might be DT is struck because 4 workspaces are open

We can go over to make separate project for each workspace IDE
1 workspace 1 project

~~First DT run is successful
~~Need to trigger Synthetic again after deleting workspaces



Next Steps: Record next script
New meeting on Monday
